#       dir_name: The top of the directory tree under which the blast databases
# reference input files and results are stored
#
# Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path. Value entered as dir_name is
# also used as a project name. Default dir_name value is "output". Change its value to store 
# the project under a different name. Using the same dir_name value for consecutive runs
# will result in deletion of the previous data and overwriting the directory tree.

# section. Multiple files are supplied as comma separated values, with no spaces between them.
# If the path contais space(s) insert \ symbol before each space. Multiple reference files will be combined
# into a single database, while each of metagenome files will be processed separately.

#       The following section contains stringency parameters for standalone BLAST procedure.
#
# alen parameter specifies a minimum pairwise alignment length required between the metagenomic contig and 
# the reference sequence. Two options that are supported: using % and absolute values for overlap.
# alen=50% will reject the alignments whose overlap is less than 50% length of min(contig,reference)
# alen=50 will reject the alignments whose overlap is less than 50 bp
# Default: alen=50%
#

alen=100
#alen=50%

# iden parameter specifies a percentage of minimum pairwise sequence identity between a contig and a reference
# Default: iden=95
# Uncomment the following line to activate adn/or change this parameter

#iden=95


#chunk_size=100
#increment=50
